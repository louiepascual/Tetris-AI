# Tetris AI

Basically, we created an agent that plays the traditional Tetris game 
using four heuristics: Aggregate Height, Complete Line, Holes, and Bumpiness.

The resulting agent was able to score 459. It can still be improved
by tweaking the weight of each heuristic and using various optimization
algorithms.
